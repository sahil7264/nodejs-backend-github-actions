docker build -t api . ----> build docker container
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 api ------> run docker container

curl http://localhost:8080

docker compose up -d --> create a container
docker compose down ---> remove the container
docker compose up -d --build --> re build code
npx gitignore node --> create ignore file for node


Problem :- 

Lets say you have hosted one server
- U installed docker there, etc things
- DID git pull
- DID docker compose up -d
- server started running
- curl http://IP_ADDRESS:8080 works

But now you have new pushes,
here you push it onto github from local
- on server again git pull
- on server again rebuild docker compose up -d --build 

This problem have been solved by github actions

Steps :- 

1. create .github folder
2. inside create workflows folder 
3. create deploy.yaml file

Now, in that yaml files, you can have env variables used
This env variables you can set from github Secrets & variables menu
